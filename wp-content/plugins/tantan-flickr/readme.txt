This Flickr plugin for WordPress will allow you to pull in your Flickr photosets and display them as albums on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

This Flickr plugin for WordPress will allow you to pull in your Flickr photosets and display them as albums on your WordPress site. There is a pretty simple template provided, but you can customize the templates 100% to match the look and feel of your own site. And if you want, you could also hook it up with Lightbox or any other number of popup overlay display libraries.

A simple Flickr widget is also included to let you easily include your photos into your sidebar.

On the backend, this plugin will also add a new Flickr icon to your WordPress edit screen which will allow you to easily insert your Flickr photos into your blog posts with just a couple clicks. You can either have your inserted photos link back to your WordPress Flickr photo album or directly to your Flickr.com photo page.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
